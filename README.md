## FAQ


**Can I use this mod in my modpack?**

Yes! You are more than welcome to include my mod in your modpack, if you credit me, and do not reupload the mod.
I would also appreciate if you told me about it üòä.

**Can I re-upload this mod?**

Short answer: No.
To clarify: You **may not** publish this mod's compiled jars somewhere else, and you may not pretend that you wrote the mod.

**Plz updat to forge**

I won't update to forge, as I have never touched it, and have no plan to do so. However, [users are reporting that it works](https://github.com/Erb3/NoHotbarLooping/issues/2) with [Sinytra Connector](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector).

**Will you update this to new MC versions?**

If I feel like it :)

**Where can I get in touch with you?**

Up-to-date contact information can be found at Erb3's [GitHub](https://github.com/Erb3/Erb3/blob/main/README.md).
